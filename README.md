*****  LinkedIn Engagement Analysis Project    *****


🔍 Ever wondered what makes a LinkedIn post blow up with likes, comments, and shares?

In this project, I built a complete pipeline using Python to analyze LinkedIn data and predict engagement scores using the XGBoost algorithm. From data cleaning to powerful visualizations and model training, everything is done step by step — just like in real-world data science workflows.

📌 What’s Inside?
🔧 Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization, encoding.

📊 EDA & Outlier Detection – Histograms, boxplots, and insights from the data.

📈 Visualizations – Correlation heatmaps and feature-wise trends (Connections, Followers, etc.).

🧠 Modeling with XGBoost – Predicting engagement scores with top features like:

Likes

Comments

Shares

Promotion Count

Post Frequency

🔍 Feature Importance – Find out what actually drives engagement on LinkedIn.

🎯 Why This Project?
This is more than just a machine learning task — it’s a deep dive into how professional content performs online. If you're into data-driven content strategy, social media analytics, or real-world ML applications, this is worth checking out.
